Project: Multi-Threaded Chat Server
A multi-threaded chat server with a client application can demonstrate all the GoF design patterns and include concurrency handling for real-time communication. This project would involve creating a server that can handle multiple client connections, distribute messages, manage user sessions, and possibly even support different types of messaging (private, public, group chats) and data (text, files).

Creational Patterns:
Singleton: Ensure that the server has a single instance running.
Factory Method: Create a factory for different types of messages or commands the server can process.
Abstract Factory: Use abstract factories for creating complex objects involved in the chat sessions, like user objects with different roles or permissions.
Builder: Allow for the construction of complex messages or user profiles.

Prototype: Use prototyping for creating copies of message templates or user states.

Structural Patterns:
Adapter: Integrate external libraries or APIs for notifications or external integrations (e.g., email notifications).
Composite: Organize users into groups for group chats.
Proxy: Use proxy objects for handling lazy instantiation or access control to certain messages or rooms.
Flyweight: Minimize memory usage for shared state objects, like user statuses or common emojis.
Bridge: Decouple abstraction from implementation, allowing different message protocols or storage mechanisms without altering the user interface.
Decorator: Add new functionalities dynamically to objects, such as message encryption or formatting.

Behavioral Patterns:
Chain of Responsibility: Process different types of commands or requests (e.g., sending a message, changing user settings) through a chain of handlers.
Command: Encapsulate commands as objects allowing for undoable operations and logging.
Interpreter: Interpret user commands or messages, especially if you support a command-like interface for certain operations.
Iterator: Traverse collections of messages or users.
Mediator: Use a mediator to handle communication between different components, reducing direct dependencies.
Memento: Allow for saving and restoring the state of a user or chat session.
Observer: Notify connected clients of new messages or events.
State: Change the behavior of user objects based on their state (e.g., online, offline, busy).
Strategy: Allow for different message handling strategies (e.g., filtering, routing).
Template Method: Define a skeleton of operations for processing messages, with steps that subclasses can override.
Visitor: Perform operations on a set of objects without changing their classes (useful for analytics or reporting).

Concurrency Patterns (Extension to Behavioral):
Locks and Synchronization: Manage access to shared resources.
Producer-Consumer: Handle message queues for processing.
Futures and Promises: Manage asynchronous operations, like fetching data or performing long-running tasks.
Reactor Pattern: Handle I/O events in a non-blocking way.
