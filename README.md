# GangOfFourChat
Python chat server intended as a tour through all of the Gang of Four design patterns

I decided to do a tour through the Gang of Four design patterns, and my old pal ChatGPT suggested a 
chat server/client as a nice opportunity to employ them all.  

I'm also getting the opportunity to build from scratch with Flask, flask_socketio, Jinja, JavaScript.  Those are all new to me.
I'm also visiting SOLID OOP design principles, and BSD server/client communication structure principles.
